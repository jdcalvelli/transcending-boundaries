# transcending-boundaries
Monorepo for all things related to Transcending Boundaries - Designing for the UN - NYU Game Center, Fall 2023

For structure's sake, let's have each of our prototypes / projects be subfolders within this repository.
Each of those subfolders should have their respective .gitignores for their respective languages :).

I'll also be using branching (because it makes life so much easier).
We can talk about this when we get closer to collaborating together on a single project!
